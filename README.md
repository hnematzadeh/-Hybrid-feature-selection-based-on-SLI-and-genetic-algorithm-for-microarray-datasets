SLI implementation:
Applying SLI: SLI is a Filter method applied on input datasets to obtain ranked features 
GArank$rand implementation:
In this step, high-ranked features of SLI-γ are given as input to GA. 
The initial quantification of population vectors plays an important role in GA method. In Garank&rand, some features are selected randomly for initial population among 1% of the features with the highest SLI-γ rank. On the other hand, some vectors are generated by the basic method in evolutionary algorithms, i.e., random initial valuation.  Figure1 shows the implementation framework.
